<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This library of EuLisp modules is trying to provide the possibility of  calling Tk functionality
from <code>youtoo</code> interpreter. We use to refer to this library as <b>youtoo/Tk</b> system.
<p>

<em><b>What is Tk?</b></em>
<dd>Tk is nothing else than a toolkit for the X Window system. Tk provides commands
for building user interfaces, so that the programmer will be able to construct Motif-like user interfaces
easily and faster. Tk gives the programmer a set of functions to create and handle user interface widgets.
Consequently the coder does not need to write large and criptyc C codes that have to interact with the X
System. Tk was created as an extension to Tcl, which is a simple scripting language for controlling
applications.
<p>

<dt>
<em><b>What is <code>youtoo</code>?</b></em>
<dd><code>youtoo</code> is one possible implementation of the object oriented programming
language EuLisp. <code>youtoo</code> was built and is still being improved by
<a href="http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk">The School of Mathematical Sciences</a> in
the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk">University of Bath</a>. EuLisp is a dialect of Lisp.
It is being discussed and created since 1985.
EuLisp provides new features to the former definitions and implementations of Lisp language.
The most important ones are:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The integration of the classical Lisp type system and the object system into a single class hierarchy.
<li>The complementary abstraction facilities provided by the class and the module mechanism.
<li>Support for concurrent execution.
</ol>
<p>
<code>youtoo</code> provides all these features defined in EuLisp language definition.

<h3>This documentation</h3>

<p>
This documentation shows some aspects of the produced binding. Some of the
commands of Tcl/Tk are not implemented, because youtoo provides the necessary features.
<p>
The next description tries to explain what has been done. The EuLisp commands always
have the correspondent Tcl/Tk command. The general syntax is the same
that the manual pages for Tcl7.5 and tk4.1 use.
<p>The manual pages could be found in the next URL:

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
This section will explain the necessary steps in order to start producing the interface.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Import the module <code>tcl-tk</code> in your import list. That is:<br>
<pre>
         (defmodule your-module
            (syntax (macros)
             import (level-1 tcl-tk))
</pre>
<li>Add all the commands and functions to create and manage Tk widgets from youtoo.<br>
There is a list of commands in <a href="functions.html">Tk commands in EuLisp</a> section.
<p>
<li>Add the event service loop at the end of your main module.<br>
More details are given in the next section <a href="#event-driven">Event-Driven applications.</a>
<p>
<li>Compilation. <a href="technical.html#install">Have you install the correspondent libraries?</a>
<ol>
<li>Be sure that the path for tcl/Tk libraries is correct in your <i>.eulrc</i> file. <br>
Path for the X library also need to be specified. That is:
<pre>
   (CLIBS . "-L<em>path</em> -lX11
             -L<em>path</em> -ltk4.1
             -L<em>path</em> -ltcl7.5
             -lm")
</pre>
<li>Compile your module. Use:
<pre>
youtoo your-module -l level-1 -l tcl-tk
</pre>
</ol>
<li>Execute your EuLisp program. Remember to set properly the environment variable DISPLAY.<br>
The generated program can also handle the <code>display</code> variable. So that:
<pre>
   your-module -display <em>your-display</em>
</pre>
</ol>

<h3>Event - Driven</h3>

<p>
Tk library works over the X System, that implies that almost everything is event-driven. That is, the execution flow is controled by events. The application reacts to determinate events.

<p>
youtoo/Tk is not indifferent to that. The applications in youtoo/Tk will be event-driven.

<p>
This is possible thanks to a couple of features that youtoo/Tk provides:
<ol>
<li>Callback mecanism. See <a href="special-cases.html#callbacks-user">How to manage callbacks</a> section.
<li>Special functions to dispatch events.
<p>
<ol>
<li><code>Tcl_DoOneEvent. </code><a href="functions.html#Tcl_DoOneEvent">Go to Tk commands section</a>
<li><code>Tk_MainLoop. </code><a href="functions.html#Tk_MainLoop">Go to Tk commands section</a>
</ol>
<p>
These two functions are enough to produce event-driven applications with youtto/Tk.
<code>Tk_MainLoop</code> loops calling <code>Tcl_DoOneEvent</code> with the blocking option.

<p>
The idea is that, if your application is single threaded it is enough using <code>Tcl_MainLoop</code>.<br>
If your application needs to be doing different things apart from being dispatching Tk event, then create a new thread. The next example will show this:

<pre>
(defun loop-function ()
  (while t
    (Tcl_DoOneEvent 1)
    (thread-reschedule)))

(deflocal loop-thread (make &lt;thread&gt; function: loop-function))
(thread-start loop-thread)
</pre>
</ol>
