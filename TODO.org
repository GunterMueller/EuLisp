*** DONE Split of word-length dependent functionality into separate modules
    CLOSED: [2010-02-23 Tue 19:31]
    Split files

*** DONE Regenerate all the .c files from the .em files to remove =eul_const=
    CLOSED: [2010-02-08 Mon 14:37]
*** DONE Remove /compat.h/
    CLOSED: [2010-02-08 Mon 22:54]
    when backward compatibility is no longer needed.
*** DONE Change all the /Makefiles/ of all the /Extras/ and /Examples/
    CLOSED: [2010-02-23 Tue 19:31]
    so that the libraries and executables are located in /platform/$(ARCH)/
    or //Lib.$(ARCH)/ and //Bin.$(ARCH)/ directories.
*** DONE Investigate warning messages from /Examples/Misc/ffi2.c/
    CLOSED: [2010-02-08 Mon 22:54]
    Creating stand-alone application of module ffi2 ...
    Compiling /ffi2.c/ using gcc ...
    //home/dm2/henry/EuLisp/youtoo/Examples/Misc/ffi2.c/: In function â€˜ff_stub_ext_foo_in
*** TODO Resolve warning messages from ffi applications
    by introducing an option to allow a header file declaring the ff's to be
    included in the stubs files.
***** Add header-files including the ffi definitions to all the /Extras/ libraries.
*** TODO Investigate when /Lib.${ARCH}/*.i/ should be copied to Lib
*** DONE Sort out the /Extras/Bignum/Makefile/
    CLOSED: [2010-02-23 Tue 19:31]
    Currently the linking of the gmp library is hard-coded.
*** DONE Upgrade the TclTk library to 8.5
    CLOSED: [2010-02-14 Sun 23:27]
*** DONE Investigate problems with the /Extras/OS/ (object serialisation) lib
    CLOSED: [2010-02-23 Tue 19:30]
*** TODO Change the MPI interface to work with OpenMPI
*** TODO /Comptime2/youtoo.em/ sometimes ends-up in the wrong state
    should be
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defmodule youtoo
      ;; Final, proper executable!
      (import (level1 math eval i-aux0 macros))

      (main *argv*)

      )  ; end of module
    #+END_SRC
    but sometimes remains in the intermediate build state
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defmodule youtoo
      ;; Preliminary executable!
      (import (level1 math eval))

      (main *argv*)

      )  ; end of module
    #+END_SRC
    during the boot-strap build.  The consequence is that the final executable
    is unable to compile module files correctly issuing errors like
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      *** ERROR [nuseq][top-level]: exported lexical binding subseq not available
      *** ERROR [nuseq][top-level]: no lexical binding defgeneric available
      *** ERROR [nuseq][top-level]: no lexical binding subseq available
      *** ERROR [nuseq][top-level]: no lexical binding seq available
    #+END_SRC
*** DONE Split the "boot" section of /Comptime2/Makefile/
    CLOSED: [2010-02-16 Tue 15:06]
    into the two parts to make the preliminary and final executables.
    Also move the "driver" part into the top-level Makefile.
*** TODO Change the /Extras/Pipe/test1.em app/
    to obtain the path of the youtoo script from the global settings obtained
    from the /.eulrc.${ARCH}/ file.
*** DONE Clean all .em files
    CLOSED: [2010-02-26 Fri 15:01]
    to remove blank line at beginning, tabs and trailing white-space.
*** TODO Add support in the REPL to load dynamically-linked module libraries
*** TODO Add support for #;(sexp) comments in /Runtime/Ff/eul-ntok.c/
*** TODO Add line-number counting to /Runtime/Ff/eul-ntok.c/
    This also requires the introduction of a line-number counting stream to hold
    the line-number and provide access to the error reporting system.
*** DONE =read-error=
    CLOSED: [2010-04-01 Thu 21:31]
    Replace the use of =error= with =read-error= in /read.em/
* EuLisp Definition
*** TODO Update EuLisp definition and Youtoo implementation
    to correspond to the EuLisp-1.0 proposals.
    See [[file:Doc/EuLisp-0.991/Proposals/Proposals.txt][proposal document]].

*** TODO Add entry for the =<method>= class in Level-1
*** TODO Add details of the =<hash-table>= class and functions
*** TODO Update stream module
    to corresponding to the Youtoo implementation.
*** DONE Add descriptions of constants to "Layout and Typography"
    CLOSED: [2010-04-01 Thu 12:16]
    in structure.tex.  Include details of constant instances of classes and
    constant bindings to classes (class aliases).
*** <thread> vs <abstract-thread>
    Sort out the difference between the EuLisp definition and the Youtoo
    implementation with respect to the name of the abstract base-class for
    threads.  In the definition it is =<thread>= whereas in Youtoo it is
    =<abstract-thread>= and =<thread>= is used for the currently used thread
    type.
*** TODO Reformat the =defgeneric= rewrite rules to conform to the others
*** TODO Consider reformatting all of the rewrite rules
    to be more consistent with the syntax description.
*** TODO Add the return type to the syntax descriptions
