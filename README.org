* Aim
  This version of the EuLisp definition and Youtoo implementation are being
  developed in an attempt to reconcile the differences with the ultimate aim to
  create a consistent definition and implementation which is as close to
  EuLisp-1.0 as is possible to ascertain from the remaining documents related to
  the standardisation process:

* General Description
  The Youtoo system is a public domain implementation of the object-oriented
  dynamic programming language EuLisp. EuLisp is a single-valued dialect of Lisp
  with an integrated object system, a defined meta-object protocol, modules and
  a simple light-weight process mechanism (threads).

  The Youtoo compiler/interpreter compiles EuLisp into C-embedded virtual
  machine code which can be statically or dynamically linked with the virtual
  machine, the conservative garbage collector, the EuLisp language library and
  arbitrary other Lisp and foreign code (C, C++ and Fortran). Resulting
  stand-alone executables are portable, interoperable and efficient (see The
  Lisp Performance Page). The language implementation is extended towards a
  Virtual Multicomputer Architecture. Object serialization and inter-process
  communication (Sockets, MPI, Harvest Object Cache) support the migration of
  arbitray data and code.

  The system reuses ideas from the Oaklisp system written by Barak Pearlmutter
  and Kevin Lang. The meta-object protocol (=Telos=) was originally implemented
  in Common Lisp by Russell Bradford. By default, a garbage collector written by
  Hans Boehm and Alan Demers is used.

* Installation
  + Unpack version xxx with \\
    /tar -xzf EuLisp-xxx.tar.gz/
  + or pull the latest version from the GitHub repository:\\
    git clone git@github.com:Henry/EuLisp.git
  + "cd" into the /EuLisp-xxx/ or /EuLisp/ directory
  + Run \\
    /./configure/ \\
    and check the settings.  Edit the configure file to reflect your system if
    necessary and re-run\\
    /./configure/.
  + Run \\
    /make/ \\
    If you want to use shared libraries (which we really recommend on Linux,
    FreeBSD, Solaris and IRIX), run \\
    /make shared/ \\
    and add the directory /.../EuLisp-xxx/Lib.${ARCH}/ to the environment variable
    ~$LD_LIBRARY_PATH~ (see /./makeso.Path/).
  + You should now be able to run the script \\
    /Bin.${ARCH}/youtoo.sh/ \\
    (see next section).

* Getting Started
  + Run \\
    /Bin.${ARCH}/youtoo.sh/ -help \\
    to see the compiler options.
  + Run \\
    /Bin.${ARCH}/youtoo.sh fact -l level1/ \\
    to compile module fact in (built-in) load directory Misc into a stand-alone
    executable. With shared libraries the executable should be less the 40K.
  + Run \\
    /Bin.${ARCH}/youtoo.sh/ \\
    without options to start the EuLisp interpreter. The read-eval-print loop
    provides extra commands (type /help:/).

* Features
*** ~/.eulrc.${ARCH}
    For private customisation, put a copy of /.eulrc.${ARCH}/ in your home
    directory.  For example, remove the optimisation flag of the C compiler.

*** EuLisp Module Files
    Have the extension /.em/.

***** EuLisp Language Level1
      Level1 is provided by the library /liblevel1.a/.
      Standard macros are defined in the syntax module macros. Thus, the default
      module body looks like this:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        (defmodule foo
          (syntax (macros)
                  import (level1))

          ...

          )  ;; end of module
      #+END_SRC

*** Pretty Printing
    The function pprint provides generic pretty printing.

*** Main
    There is no main entry function Top-level forms in modules are executed with
    with respect to the module hierarchy. Global variables =*argc*= and =*argv*=
    are provided.

*** Standard Bindings
    See /Doc/bindings.txt/ for a list of standard bindings.

*** Module Compilation
    The compiler checks before compiling a module which (directly and
    indirectly) imported modules really need to be (re)compiled. This feature
    can be switched off with =-no_recompile=.

*** Standard C foreign-functions
    in /Vm/eulisp.h/

***** Data conversion from EuLisp to C:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        int     eul_int_as_c_int(LispRef x);
        int     eul_bool_as_c_bool(LispRef x);

        LispRef c_bool_as_eul_bool(bool x)
        LispRef c_char_as_eul_char(char x);
      #+END_SRC

***** Creating symbols and keywords:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        eul_intern_symbol(LispRef loc, char *str);
        eul_intern_keyword(LispRef loc, char *str);
      #+END_SRC

***** EuLisp data allocation:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        eul_allocate_int(LispRef loc, int x);
        eul_allocate_double(LispRef loc, double x);
        eul_allocate_char(LispRef loc, char x);
        eul_allocate_string(LispRef loc, char *str);
        eul_allocate_cons(LispRef loc, LispRef x, LispRef y);
        eul_allocate_vector(LispRef loc,int n, LispRef init);
        eul_allocate_object(LispRef loc, LispRef class, LispRef n, LispRef init);
      #+END_SRC

***** EuLisp constants:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        LispRef eul_nil;
        LispRef eul_t;
      #+END_SRC

      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        LispRef eul_car(LispRef x);
        LispRef eul_cdr(LispRef x);
        LispRef eul_slot_ref(LispRef x, int i);
        LispRef eul_symbol_name(LispRef x);
        LispRef eul_keyword_name(LispRef x);

        LispRef eul_size_of(LispRef x);
        LispRef eul_string_size(LispRef x);
      #+END_SRC

***** EuLisp data predicates:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c
        int eul_null(LispRef x);

        int eul_is_gf(LispRef x);
        int eul_is_lambda(LispRef x);
        int eul_is_operator(LispRef x);
      #+END_SRC

*** Using the foreign-function interface
    Uses automatic converters. Here is an example how atoi can be used from
    Lisp:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defextern atoi () )
    #+END_SRC
    If the desired external function foo is in library libbar.a and should be
    called baz in Lisp the following defining form is necessary:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defextern baz (...) ... "foo")
    #+END_SRC
    To link the library /libbar.a/, put a copy of /.eulrc.${ARCH}/ in your
    home directory and add -lbar to the list of ~$CLIBS~; the library path must
    be given with ~-L<bar-path>~ in the list of ~$CFLAGS~.

***** Automatic type conversion
      The following automatic converters are available:
      |---------------+-----------|
      | Lisp          | C (C99)   |
      |---------------+-----------|
      | =<int>=       | =int=     |
      | =<character>= | =char=    |
      | =<double>=    | =double=  |
      | =<string>=    | =char*=   |
      | =boolean=     | =bool=    |
      | =ptr=         | =void*=   |
      | =<int*>=      | =int*=    |
      | =<double*>=   | =double*= |
      | =<string*>=   | =char**=  |
      |---------------+-----------|

      The =ptr= converter can be used to pass arbitrary C99 structures to Lisp,
      so that they can be passed back to C at a later stage. The ptr converter
      is also useful to pass a Lisp object unconverted to C99.
***** =defextern=
      =defextern= definitions can not be linked dynamically.
***** =DEFINTERN=
      Foreign in-calls have to use the DEFINTERN() macro. Examples for
      in/out-calls to/from Lisp can be found in the directories /Examples/Misc/,
      /Examples/Fortran/, and /Examples/C++/.

*** Macro expansion
    is un-hygienic.

*** EuLisp Scripts
    Use /#!/../youtoo --script/ to write EuLisp scripts (see
    /Examples/Misc/script.em/).

*** Inter-operation with other languages
    The examples in directory C++ and Fortran show how to interoperate with
    these languages.

*** List operators
    Arithmetic functions =+=, =-= and =/= operate as set union, difference and
    intersection on lists.

*** Examples
    Directory /Examples/ contains modules for explanation and reuse.

*** Bindings
    The current set of supported bindings in Youtoo are in the file
    [[http://henry.github.com/EuLisp/Doc/bindings.txt][bindings.txt]]

* Modules

    processes.

* Bootstrapping
  Building Youtoo from the EuLisp sources is termed "bootstrapping".  This
  requires a working installation which is used to compile the EuLisp source
  modules.  The default directory path to the bootstrapping installation is
  /${EUL_DIR}.boot/, i.e. /.boot/ appended to the path of the current
  directory.  Note that if the bootstrapping installation directory is renamed
  or moved the /configure/ script should be executed in it after the move to
  correct the paths.  The working directory can be "cleaned" for bootstrapping
  using /make boot-clean/ and then the "bootstrapping" build process started
  with /make boot/.  If all goes well a complete clean build will result.

  This process allows changes and developments to be made to the Youtoo
  implementation of EuLisp.

*** Limitations
    Currently the dependency analysis is not sufficient to cover all the
    possible ways in which the changes to the EuLisp modules in Youtoo interact
    and the rebuilds required to create a consistent Youtoo executable.  Thus to
    be sure of success /make boot-clean/ maybe required before every /make
    boot/.

*** Notes
    The syntax files _.*0.em are used to enable the transition between old and
    new function names during the bootstrapping process.  If functions change
    which affect the syntax files first change the non "_" versions,
    bootstrap-build then update the /.boot/ version with the current, update the
    "_" versions to correspond to the non "_" versions and bootstrap-build
    again.  This ensures a consistent final version.

* Recent Developments
*** Support for 64bit Operation
    The main change to support 64bit pointers is that on such architectures the
    =Instruction= is a 16bit integer rather than an 8bit =char= so that 4
    =Instructions= still fit exactly in a pointer.  This allows most of the
    stack pointer incrementing to remain unchanged.  However, a very large
    number of small changes were also necessary.  The C-files are compatible
    between the 32bit and 64bit versions.

*** C99 Compliance
    The code is now C99 compliant and uses C99 data types and constructs so a
    C99 compiler is required e.g. =gcc-4.?.?=.

*** Rationalisation of the Makefiles
    The =Makefiles= have been rationalised and simplified by using many features
    in the GNU version of =make=, =gmake= which is now required to build
    =youtoo=.

*** The start of the EuLisp-1.0 compliance process
    Many small changes to improve consistency between the Youtoo implementation
    and the EuLisp-0.99 definition and the documents relating to the creation of
    EuLisp-1.0.
