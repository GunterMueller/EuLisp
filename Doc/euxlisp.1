[1mNAME[0m
       euxlisp - EuLisp Level 0 interpreter

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1meuxlisp [22m[ [4mcommand-line[24m [4mswitches[24m ] [ [4mfiles[24m [4m...[24m ]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4meuxlisp[24m  is  a  small EuLisp Level 0 interpeter, based on David Michael
       Betz' xscheme.  Mostly compliant with the EuLisp definition 0.99,  with
       a few Schemeisms still present.

   [1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are of general interest:

              [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
                     display usage information.

              [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[0m
                     quiet  mode: print no messages, prompts or values. Useful
                     when using [4meuxlisp[24m as a filter or other agent.

              [1m-n[22m, [1m--no-lisp-image[0m
                     do not read in the initial Lisp image.

              [1m-N[22m, [1m--no-sys-calls[0m
                     disables [1msystem [22mand various other function calls.

              [1m-s [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--script [4m[22mfile[0m
                     read and execute script [4mfile[24m, skipping  its  first  line.
                     Useful  for [1m#!/bin/euxlisp --script [22mand the like in shell
                     scripts.

              [1m-m [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--module [4m[22mfile[0m
                     read and execute module from [4mfile[24m.

              [1m-i [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--image [4m[22mfile[0m
                     read the given image [4mfile[24m rather than the default.

              [1m-t[22m, [1m--trace[0m
                     switch on byte-code level tracing.

              Other args are not interpreted, but are available though  [1mgetarg[0m
              (see below)


[1mFEATURES[0m
       The  module that contains all the useful stuff (e.g., [1mcons [22mand friends)
       is called [1mlevel-0[22m: if you import no modules, you get  nothing  at  all,
       not even special forms. So a typical module looks like

       [1m(defmodule foo[0m
          [1m(syntax (syntax-0)[0m
           [1mimport (level-0 ...))[0m

          [1m...[0m
       [1m)[0m

       and should be in a file named [1mfoo.em[0m

       There are keywords (unbindable, unassignable, self-evaluating symbols),
       e.g.,

       [1m(defclass foo ()[0m
         [1m((a default: 99[0m
             [1mkeyword: a:[0m
             [1maccessor: foo-a))[0m
         [1mconstructor: (make-foo a:))[0m


       Try [1m(describe xx) [22mfor information on object [1mxx[22m,  and  [1m(class-hierarchy)[0m
       to see all the classes.

       Some useful other tools include:

       [1mgetenv [22mand [1mputenv [22mto get and set environment variables.

       [1mgetarg [22mto get [4mn[24mth arg passed to [1meuxlisp.[0m

       [1mexit   [22mto leave [1meuxlisp[0m

       In  case  of error, there is a simple error loop. When in the loop type
       [1mhelp: [22mfor extra information.


[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [1mEU_IMAGE_PATH[0m
              a colon-separated list of directory names: where to look for the
              initial  EuLisp  image  (generally  named \uxlisp.wks[1m).  euxlisp[0m
              searches these first, then a system-installed path.

       [1mEU_MODULE_PATH[0m
              a colon-separated list of directory names:  where  to  look  for
              EuLisp  modules.   [1meuxlisp  [22msearches these first, then a system-
              installed path (which generally contains the current directory).


[1mBUGS[0m
       If  [1meuxlisp  [22mstarts  up  in  module  [1mroot [22mthen it is a good bet that it
       couldn't find the image file [1meuxlisp.wks[0m

       There are a few differences between [1meuxlisp [22mand the EuLisp Level 0 def-
       inition, but as both are still changing it's futile to list them.
