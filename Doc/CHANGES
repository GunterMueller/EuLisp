* (print (convert '(#\a bcd foo: #\e "fghijk") <string>))
* first-class labels when compiled with gcc
* fast default arithmetic; eg (+ x y z) -> (int-binary+ (int-binary+ x y) z)
* sort as generic function
* sort!, reverse! and append! are destructive versions of the functions without the exclamation mark
* +, - and / work on sets represented as lists
