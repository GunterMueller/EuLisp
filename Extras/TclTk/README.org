* General Description
  This directory contains the Tcl/Tk connection for youtoo. This file tells you
  how to install it.

* Installation
  + Edit the /Makefile/ (if necessary).
  + Run 'make' in directory /TclTk/
  + Add '-ltcltk -lX11 -ltk83 -ltcl83' to CLIBS in /youtoo/\.eulrc.${ARCH}/;
    perhaps also -ldl (eg for Linux) is necessary
  + Add '-L<EUL_X_LIB_DIR> -L<EUL_TCL_LIB_DIR> -L<EUL_TK_LIB_DIR>'
    to CLIBS in EuLysses/.eulrc if necessary.
  + Add '-I<EUL_X_INCLUDE_DIR> -I<EUL_TCL_INCLUDE_DIR> -I<EUL_TK_INCLUDE_DIR>"
    to CFLAGS in EuLysses.eulrc if necessary.
  + Test with 'cd /Test/; /Bin.${ARCH}/youtoo.sh/ tk_graph_editor -l level1 -l
    tcltk'

*** Installation of the you2tk' youtoo/Tk Interpreter
    + Run 'make you2tk'
    + make sure your ~LD_LIBRARY_PATH~ environment variable is set correctly
      (you could edit EuLysses/you2tk to add <EUL_TCL_LIB_DIR> <EUL_TK_LIB_DIR>
      <EUL_X_LIB_DIR>)

***** Example test for you2tk
      Run 'Bin.${ARCH}/you2tk.sh' and type
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defun foo (b x)
        (print b)
        (tk-button-flash b))

        (let ((b1 (tk-make-button () text: "foo" command: foo args: '(self: 42)))
          (b2 (tk-make-button () text: "exit" fg: "red" command: tk-exit)))
          (tk-pack b1 b2 padx: "10" pady: "3"))

        (tk-main-loop)

      #+END_SRC

* WARNING
  The original version of the Tcl/Tk code used various Tk internals that changed
  completely between the 7.6/4.2 and 8.3.4/8.3.4 releases.  The code has since
  been crudely beaten into a semblance of submission, but it is surely full of
  resentment and bugs.
