* General Description
  This is an interface module to the GNU Bignum package.

* Installation
  + Run 'make' in directory /Extras/Bignum/.
  + Run 'make test' in directory /Extras/Bignum/.
  + Add -lbignum to CLIBS in /youtoo/\.eulrc.${ARCH}/.

* Files
  The bignum library consists of a number of EuLisp modules:
  - /bignum.em/ -- root module
  - /bigint.em/ -- big integer module and class
  - /bigrat.em/ -- rational number module and class
  - /mpz.em/    -- module containing bindings to c functions
  - /mpq.em/    -- module containing bindings to c functions

  And three C files:
  - /eul-mpz.c/ -- C interface for integer functions
  - /eul-mpq.c/ -- C interface for rational functions
  - /eul-gmp-gc.c/ -- C interface to GC

* To Do
  + rationals are not integrated into EuLisp
  + check everything is being GC-ed properly
