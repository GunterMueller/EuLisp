* General Description
  Modulized version of match-slib.scm badly hacked for eulisp.

* Notes:
  + Vectors probably don't work right.
  + Why doesn't #(a b c ...) match what PLT Scheme gives for the same thing?
  + Structures certainly don't.
  + Use of modified vector-ref -- should original be changed?

* Installation
  + Run 'make' in directory /Extras/Match/.
  + Run 'make test' in directory /Extras/Match/.
