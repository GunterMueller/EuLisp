Known bugs in feel0-92 

o memory fault in garbage collector when running big tasks with bytecode
  interpreter -- information leading to its capture would be greatly
  appreciated

o memory fault when processing -do command-line option (undocumented)

o substring errors if path variables defined with no value

o pvm and pvm3 modules probably don't work with SYSV configuration

o the SYSV configuration hasn't been tested recently (not strictly
  speaking a bug, but an indication that there probably are some
  in there somewhere...)

o the memory management system allocates twice the size of heap
  requested on the grounds that the gc is a two-space collector;
  this is not necessarily wrong, but is misleading

o occasional 'class-precedence' errors -- information leading to
  their capture would be much appreciated

o generics don't handle rest lists (fixed in next version)
