------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Feel -- the reference implementation of the EuLisp language. 

Extremely brief intro to EuLisp:
--------------------------------
EuLisp is a single-valued dialect of Lisp with the following
features: 

o An integrated object system (Telos) with a defined meta-object
  protocol to enable reflective programming.

o A module system.

o A simple light-weight process mechanism.

Feel is intended to conform to the EuLisp definition. The present
version is close in many respects, but there are still numerous minor
discrepancies.

Read the EuLisp definition and the Feel manual for more details.

Basic Distribution: ftp.bath.ac.uk: /pub/eulisp/feel-0.92.tgz

 Includes Feel binaries for Sun4, SGI (Irix), and Stardent Titan,
 and all sources needed to build Feel for your own machine(s).

 Either set the shell variable FEEL_PATH to the directory where you
 have installed FEEL, or make a symbolic link called 'Feel' in your
 home directory to the installation.

 The script 'feel' in the distribution bin directory should then set
 up all the right paths, etc., and execute the appropriate binary --
 make a link to this script from a directory in your path, or put the
 bin directory into your path.  The 'feel' shell script automatically
 boots the system with a bytecoded image.  If you wish to byte-compile
 your own modules, use the 'feelc' shell script in a similar way --
 see the Feel manual for details.

 In the Src directory is everything needed to build Feel for your
 machine.  After changing some variables, and selecting a configuration
 in the Makefile, you should be able to type 'make install', and get a
 working system. Read the Makefile and the Feel manual for the options
 that may need changing for your system. You may need to do a 'make
 depend' to get the dependencies right although this is not absolutely
 necessary.

 NB. flex-2.4.6 is now a prerequisite for building Feel from scratch.

 NB. The binaries provided include pvm and pvm3 user libraries (see
 documentation on the PVM module in the Feel manual), and the Makefile
 will also by default try to link local pvm and pvm3 libraries into any
 new Feel binaries.
